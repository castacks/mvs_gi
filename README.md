This is the official code repository for the paper: "Geometry-Informed Distance Candidate Selection
for Adaptive Lightweight Omnidirectional Stereo Vision with Fisheye Images".

# Overview

We are working on providing better details about our work, including the code, datasets, pre-trained models
, and more. Please stay tuned while things are progressing. 

At the current moment, we provide instructions on how to run our pre-trained models locally. Please refer
