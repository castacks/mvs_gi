This is the official code repository for the paper: "Geometry-Informed Distance Candidate Selection
for Adaptive Lightweight Omnidirectional Stereo Vision with Fisheye Images".

# Overview

We are working on providing better details about our work, including the code, datasets, pre-trained
models , and more. Please stay tuned while things are progressing. 

At the current moment, we provide instructions on how to run our pre-trained models locally. Please
refer to the [Offline validation instructions](docs/offline_validation/README.md) for more details.

For the developers, [here](docs/original_home_page_readme/README.md) is the original README page.
